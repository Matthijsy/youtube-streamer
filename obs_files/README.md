### OBS Files
This directory is automatically used by OBS. 

- pre_service.mp3 -> The audio file that is used for the 'pre-service' scene
- pre_service.jpg -> The image that is used for the 'pre-service' scene

Those defaults could be temporary overwritten by instering a USB device with this file structure into the device before booting. Those files will only be used as long as the USB device is inserted.
